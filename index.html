            <p>Zach is a UT Austin Grad with a BS in CS & Physics (2015)</p>
          </div>
          <p>Zach has spent the past four or so years working on a simple concept:</p>
          <p>a. Make multiplayer choose your own adventure novels possible</p>
          <p>
            The maximally expressive and sharable way to create multiplayer cyoas is via webpages
          </p>
          <p> So while we're at it why not try to bootstrap another platform for selling videogames? Maybe we can make it the year of the javascript game. </p>
          <p> The logic mutliplayer cyoa's can also function as a sophisticated lobby </p>
          <p>Ultimately the vision would be something kind of like a hybrid of roblox/itch.io/agar.io (but it would be cooler than roblox from a dev perspective since everyone could see the source code for every game)</p>
          <a href=""> So here's a link to that</a>
          <p> Prior to that I worked part time at the TACC advanced computing center doing some bash/python scripting, I also worked a bit in Proff. Ali Yilmaz's lab as a summer intern (he studies how em waves propagate throught he human body) (also python scripting)</p>
          <p> I know javascript, react, plpgsql, haskell (I have a pretty imperative style of writing haskell), nixos (actually submitted a fix to a race condition in nixops a few years back), bash (really I feel like I can write code in any programming language, don't think I would say I'm an expert at any of them though (in school I wrote stuff in c, java, objective c, swift, python))</p>
          <p> I think I would be pretty good as a Data Engineer. I also think I could function pretty well in a remote first company.</p>
          <h4> Motivation </h4>
          <p>
            So why would Zach want to be a data engineer?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, I had enough inherited wealth to pretty much drop out of the sytem for four years, and could go for a lot longer at my current burn rate. (actually I have more money now than I did four years ago but I'm all cash at this point, and going forward I think equity return is going to be like 3%).
          </p>
          <p>
            However from the perspective of 99% of people I don't have FU money.
            I'm still relatively young (26) and would like to experiment a bit with more lifestyle changes since I've pretty thoroughly explored the cheap end of the spectrum (quite expert at building standing desks out of boxes or library books, tried sleeping in a hammock, ate diy soylent for a couple years (like $3 a day)). Think hiring a personal trainer, having health insurance (lol), maybe braces, living next to a hackerspace instead of with my parents, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, equally importantly, it's pretty clear at this point that while the project is possible it will take quite a while (at least without vc which I don't want, and in fact I would prefer to run the business as a lifestyle business, assuming it succeeds). If I had a couple years of salary saved up I could afford to pay more people to scale up the business/take it off my hands without bankrupting myself, so that would be nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also I've been to a lot of meetups. Dar seems like a good guy. So this is only the second time I've a applied for a position in the past 4 years. Plus it helped motivate me to get my site deployed lol. I think data science is interesting if somewhat scary (sometimes I browse the the arxiv, cs new is like 90% neural nets lol). Haven't done much myself as far as machine learning or stats is concerned on account of trying to be linearly independent from the rest of society so I can do my best work as a living gpu core.
